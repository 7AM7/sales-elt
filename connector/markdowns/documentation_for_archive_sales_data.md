# Python Script Documentation: Export Data to File

Introduction:
The python script is designed to export data to a specific data source. It is used in the context of the Mage AI platform, which is a data management and analytics platform. The script is a template for exporting data to the filesystem and is designed to be used with the Mage AI platform. It utilizes the FileIO library for exporting data and the get_repo_path function to determine the filepath.

Functionality:
The script takes in a DataFrame as input and exports it to a CSV file in the specified filepath. It uses the current date and time to create a unique filename for the exported data. The exported file is saved in the "archive" folder under the "sales" subfolder. The exported data is saved without the index column.

Usage:
The script is designed to be used with the Mage AI platform and can be called using the @data_exporter decorator. It can be used to export data from any source to the Mage AI platform for further analysis and processing.

Documentation:
The script is documented using the triple backticks notation, which is a common way to document code in markdown files. The documentation includes a brief description of the script, its purpose, and a link to the Mage AI platform documentation for further reference
