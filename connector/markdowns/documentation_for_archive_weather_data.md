# Python Script for Exporting Data to a Specific Data Source

This python script is designed to export data to a specific data source using the Mage AI library. It is a template that can be used for exporting data to the filesystem, and it is specifically designed for the Mage AI platform.

## Importing Libraries
The first few lines of the script import the necessary libraries for the script to run. These include the `os` library for file and directory operations, the `datetime` library for working with dates and times, the `FileIO` class from the `mage_ai.io.file` module, and the `DataFrame` class from the `pandas` library.

## Data Exporter Decorator
The `@data_exporter` decorator is used to mark the `export_data_to_file` function as a data exporter. This decorator is provided by the Mage AI library and is used to register the function as a data exporter. This allows the function to be called by other parts of the Mage AI platform when data needs to be exported.

## Export Data to File Function
The `export_data_to_file` function is the main function of the script. It takes in a `DataFrame` object as its first argument and any additional keyword arguments that may be needed.
