# Python Script for Loading Data from API

This python script is used to load data from a specific data source, in this case, an API. It uses the pandas library for data manipulation and the requests library for making HTTP requests.

The script starts by importing the necessary libraries, namely pandas and requests. It also checks if the "data_loader" and "test" functions are already defined in the global scope. If not, it imports them from the "mage_ai.data_preparation.decorators" module.

Next, the script defines a function named "load_data_from_api" which is decorated with the "data_loader" decorator. This decorator is used to mark the function as a data loader, which means it will be used to load data from a specific data source.

The function takes in two parameters, *args and **kwargs, which allow for passing in any number of arguments and keyword arguments to the function. This makes the function more flexible and able to handle different types of data sources.

Inside the function, a URL is defined for the API endpoint from which the data will be fetched. The requests library is then used to make a GET request to the URL. The response object is stored in a variable named "response".

The script then checks if the request was successful
