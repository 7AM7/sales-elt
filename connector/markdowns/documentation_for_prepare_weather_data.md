# Python Script Documentation: Data Transformation

## Introduction
The python script is designed to transform data from one format into a different format. It is used to load data from an API and convert it into a pandas DataFrame. The script uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data for a given location and adds it to the existing DataFrame.

## Business Logic
The main function in the script is the `execute_transformer_action` function, which is decorated with `@transformer`. This function takes in a pandas DataFrame as input and returns a transformed DataFrame as output. The function also takes in optional arguments and keyword arguments, which can be used to customize the transformation process.

The `execute_transformer_action` function first loads the necessary libraries and imports the required modules. It then checks if the `transformer` and `test` decorators are already defined in the global scope. If not, it imports them from the `mage_ai.data_preparation.decorators` module.

Next, the function defines the `get_weather` function, which is used to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. It takes in a row from the DataFrame, the API key, and the base URL as parameters. It then uses the `requests` library to make a GET request to the
