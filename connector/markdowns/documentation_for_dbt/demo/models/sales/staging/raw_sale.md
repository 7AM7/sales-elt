The sql script is used to generate a table called "raw_sale" that contains data from the "sales_pipeline_load_sales_data" table in the "mage_demo" database. The table will have the following columns: "sale_id", "order_id", "customer_id", "product_id", "quantity", "price", and "order_date". The "sale_id" column is generated using the "dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key" function, which combines the "order_id" and "product_id" columns and converts them to text. This ensures that each row in the "raw_sale" table has a unique identifier. The "order_date" column is also included in the "raw_sale" table. Finally, the "SELECT * FROM raw_sale" statement is used to select all columns and rows from the "raw_sale" table. This sql script can be used to quickly and efficiently extract data from the "sales_pipeline_load_sales_data" table and store it in a new table for further analysis.
