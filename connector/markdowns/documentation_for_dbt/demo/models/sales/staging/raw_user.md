This sql script is used to retrieve data from the "sales_pipeline_load_user_data" table in the "mage_demo" database. The data is then processed and selected to create a new table with the following columns: user_id, name, username, email, phone, website, address.street, address.suite, address.city, address.zipcode, address.geo.lat, address.geo.lng, company.name, company.catchPhrase, and company.bs.

The script first sets the configuration to create a new table with the materialized property set to "table". This means that the data will be stored in a new table rather than just being queried.

Next, the script creates a temporary table called "raw_users" by selecting all columns from the "sales_pipeline_load_user_data" table. This table will be used to process and select the desired data.

Finally, the script selects the desired columns from the "raw_users" table and renames them accordingly. The "address" and "company" columns are further broken down into sub-columns for more specific data.

Overall, this sql script is used to retrieve and process data from the "sales_pipeline_load_user_data" table and create a new table with the desired columns and data.
