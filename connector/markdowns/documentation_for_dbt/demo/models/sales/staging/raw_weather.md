The sql script is used to generate a table called "raw_weathers" by selecting all columns from the "sales_pipeline_prepare_weather_data" table in the "mage_demo" database. The table is also given a unique identifier using the "dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key" function, which combines the values from the "weather_lat" and "weather_lng" columns to create a unique ID for each row. This table is then used to store weather data for the sales pipeline. The "config" function is used to specify that the table should be materialized, meaning it will be physically created in the database. Finally, the "SELECT * FROM raw_weathers" statement is used to retrieve all data from the "raw_weathers" table.
