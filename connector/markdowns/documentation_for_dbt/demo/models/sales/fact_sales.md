The above sql script is used to create a materialized view called "fact_sale" which contains data from the "raw_sale" table. This materialized view has a unique key of "sale_id".

The script then selects data from the "fact_sale" view and joins it with two other tables, "dim_user" and "dim_weather". The join is based on the "customer_id" and "user_id" columns, and the "lat" and "lng" columns respectively.

The final result of the script includes columns such as "sale_id", "order_id", "customer_id", "product_id", "order_date", "quantity", "price", "city", "weather_id", "weather_temperature", and "weather_conditions".

If the script is being run incrementally, it will only select data where the "order_date" is greater than or equal to the maximum "order_date" in the current table. It also ensures that the "dbt_valid_to" column in the "dim_user" table is null, indicating that the user is still active.

Overall, this sql script is used to create a materialized view that combines data from multiple tables and can be used for reporting and analysis purposes.
