Python Script Documentation:

The python script is used to load data from a specific data source, in this case, a csv file. It begins by importing necessary libraries and setting up the environment. The script checks if the "data_loader" and "test" functions are already defined in the global scope, and if not, imports them from the mage_ai.data_preparation.decorators module.

The main function of the script is the "load_data_from_file" function, which is decorated with the "data_loader" decorator. This decorator is used to mark the function as a data loader, which means it will be used to load data from a specific source.

The function takes in *args and **kwargs as parameters, which allows for flexibility in passing arguments to the function. The function also has a docstring, which provides a brief description of what the function does.

Inside the function, the first step is to construct the filepath to the data source. This is done using the "get_repo_path" function from the mage_ai.settings.repo module, which returns the path to the repository where the script is located. The filepath is then joined with the relative path to the csv file, which is "data/sales_data.csv".

Next, the script uses the pandas library to read the
